The Roland FP-60 and FP-90 are awesome pianos: great touch, great piano sound.

But the Registrations feature has some quirks, and editing Registrations on the piano can get tedious.

And Roland's MIDI documentation is limited and not entirely accurate.

This project attempts to address both problems to make your FP even more enjoyable.
